# Algorithms
A collection of classic computer science algorithms implemented in C.

## Executing the Code

- gcc -o prog_name prog_file.c
- ./prog_name

## Implemented Algorithms

- Binary Search.c:
  Allows users to input the size of an array and fill it with integer elements. The user is then prompted for the value they want to find the index of. Binary search is then used to find the index of the target element. If    the element exists, the index is printed on the screen. Otherwise, an error message reports that the value does not exist in the given array.

  ### Sample Output:
